# Loyalty Programs Digital Punch Cards and Reward Systems
This project aims to create a system for loyalty programs featuring digital punch cards and QR code integration.

## Key Features:
- Digital punch cards for customers.
- Reward system based on accumulated punches.
- QR code generation and scanning for punch validation and reward redemption.
- User authentication for customers and administrators.
- Admin panel for managing programs, rewards, and users.

## Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React (JavaScript)
- Styling: (To be decided - e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material UI, plain CSS)
- Backend: (To be decided - e.g., Node.js with Express, Firebase, Supabase)
- Database: (To be decided - depends on backend choice)

## Development Guidelines:
- Prioritize clear, maintainable code.
- Implement user-friendly interfaces.
- Ensure security best practices, especially for user data and QR code validation.
- Write unit and integration tests for critical functionalities.

## QR Code Strategy:
- Generate unique QR codes for each punch action or customer.
- Implement a secure way to validate QR codes to prevent fraud.
- Consider offline capabilities or graceful degradation if internet connectivity is an issue during QR code scanning.

## Reward System Logic:
- Define flexible reward rules (e.g., "X punches for Y reward").
- Allow for different types of rewards (discounts, free items, etc.).
- Track reward redemption.

## Future Considerations:
- Analytics for program performance.
- Notifications for customers (e.g., new rewards, expiring punches).
- Integration with other systems (e.g., POS).
